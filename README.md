## intro :
thank you for your intresting !
it seems hard to find roots for complex quadratic equation. so what about finding it for cubic equation that is already hard to get quicker.
that is one of motiviation to type this code plus it was a task that i have to finish in my college plus it was a challenge to be written in c language
especially when i didn't find good ready code to copy for college's task XD

## details:
comming later becuase i'm tired now
