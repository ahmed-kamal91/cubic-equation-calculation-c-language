## intro :
thank you for your intresting !</br>
it seems hard to find roots for complex quadratic equation. so what about finding it for cubic equation that is already hard to get quicker. </br>
that is one of motiviation to type this code plus it was a task that i have to finish in my college plus it was a challenge to be written in c language</br>
especially when i didn't find good ready code to copy for college's task XD</br>

## details:
comming later becuase i'm tired now
